# DBPediaVectorRepresentationExtracting Vector Representation of DBPedia Properties from word2vec

Vector representation of words has been learned by word2vec and useful in many natural language
processing and information retrieval. However, the advantages that can be utilized by applying
word2vec have not been applied for Dbpedia data. In this paper, word2vec for Dbpedia properties is
proposed. The main goals of Extracting Vector Representation of Dbpedia Properties are to
disambiguate terms given by users with the intention of finding their corresponding resources from
the Dbpedia and to apply Word2Vec technique to find missing information.
